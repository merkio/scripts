For the record and future me, this is what needs to be done to disable Traefik during initial setup:

Remove traefik helm chart resource: kubectl -n kube-system delete helmcharts.helm.cattle.io traefik
Stop the k3s service: sudo service k3s stop
Edit service file sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service and add this line to ExecStart:
    --no-deploy traefik \
Reload the service file: sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Remove the manifest file from auto-deploy folder: sudo rm /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/traefik.yaml
Start the k3s service: sudo service k3s start
